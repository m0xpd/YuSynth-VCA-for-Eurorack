This folder contains design files for a front panel for the Eurorack version of the YuSynth VCA, developed in Kicad. 

This files constitute a simple [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) project, which defines the panel - you may wish to modify my design to 'personalise' it.

The process of Gerber and drill file generation in Kicad seems to me to be a little more 'clunky' than in Eagle, but you'll find on-line tutorials 
explaining how to do it.

My panel is seen here:
