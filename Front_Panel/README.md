[This folder](https://github.com/m0xpd/YuSynth-VCA-for-Eurorack/tree/main/Front_Panel) contains design files for a front panel for the Eurorack version of the YuSynth VCA, developed in [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/). 

The files constitute a simple [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) project - you may wish to modify my design to 'personalise' it.

The process of Gerber and drill file generation in Kicad seems to me to be a little more 'clunky' than in Eagle (because I'm used to Eagle's CAM
processor), but you'll find plenty of on-line tutorials explaining how to do it (such as [this one](https://www.lioncircuits.com/faq/pcb-fab/how-to-generate-the-gerber-files-using-kicad)).

My panel is seen here:
