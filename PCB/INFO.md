This folder contains design files for the Eurocard version of the YuSynth VCA printed circuit board developed in AutoCAD EAGLE.

These can be loaded into the (free) version of Eagle:
https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/eagle/features
and are ready for the CAM processor to produce Gerber files ready to send to a PCB house. 

I have used JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) to produce the prototype seen in the pictures below (usual disclaimer). 
JLCPCB offer a file to set up the CAM processor to produce the Gerbers in the correct format - it is available (along with some guidelines) here:

I'm sure the other PCB houses offer an equivalent service - but I can't speak from first-hand experience.

The unpopulated board is seen here:

and the populated board is seen here (both from the 'front side', usually obscured by the front panel and from the back):
